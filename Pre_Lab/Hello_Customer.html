      I want create a simple website for booking in the laudry room, the
      reason for this idea because of the invoncince in creating and checking
      the boooking time for my laudry. In my apartment, we have a piece of
      paper that allow people to write down there name and day that they want
      to used the laudry. This piece of paper supposed to be replace each week
      but it had stop doing that so now in the apartment there are only the
      same pice with a lot of random time that people booking. This process
      can be better by using a simple QR code that allow people into a website
      page where that cam view and the booking website and easily with there
      phone.
